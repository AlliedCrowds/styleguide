## PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code

> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds

AlliedCrowds follows [The Pocoo Style Guide](http://www.pocoo.org/internal/styleguide/), which follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). The below amends and overides each.

Use double quotes `"` around strings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages, and single quotes `'` for small symbol-like strings. 

Example:

```
language = {

    'english' : "Hey, what's up"

    'british' : "Hey, are you alright?"

}
```

When dealing with a natural language string with quotes, use single quotes.
